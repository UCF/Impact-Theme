    			<p><strong>Pamela McCauley</strong> leads a team of UCF planetary science researchers who made history in 2016 for creating the first experiment to be launched into space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard. With the MEDEA project, the physics professor and his students are seeking answers to cosmic questions about how space dust accumulates to form planets and the rings around planets in an effort to better understand our own world.</p>

				<p>“‘We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.’ With these words, President John F. Kennedy roused America’s support of space exploration in 1962. He also acknowledged the geopolitical competition with the Soviet Union that provided the impetus to make mankind’s greatest technological achievement a possibility. Absent that Cold War motivation, our manned space program has languished in low Earth orbit for the last 40 years. That drought drives home the point that we must return to the spirit of human exploration of the final frontier exemplified by the Apollo program. The need to see what is over the next horizon — and not to simply see it, but to actually touch it — is a fundamental aspect of human nature. Those horizons beckon on countless asteroids, the moon and Mars.”</p>

				<p>“The manned exploration of space is an expression of one of our finest aspects — curiosity. To truly satisfy that curiosity we need to be participants. [Many experts say that] robotic space program is a far more cost-effective means of advancing our scientific knowledge of the universe, and I could not agree more. While valuable advances have been made because of the manned program, it cannot and should not be justified on the grounds of scientific advancement. It is instead about something equally important as science — the inspiration of our species to pursue lofty goals.”</p>

				<p>“A lot of the future of space exploration is reusability, and SpaceX is looking at that. The space shuttle was reusable, but because it was such a large and complex system … it didn’t really bring the cost down the way they had originally imagined it would. SpaceX, on the other hand, is now regularly recovering their first-stage boosters, and they’ve announced plans to send a capsule to land on Mars in 2018 at a much lower cost than what it would have been with the old launch architectures.”</p>

				<p>“I think broader access to space is great for us as a university because it gives us more opportunities to get students involved in space projects. That’s one of the things we really strive for. So much progress is being made in space, and students are in a position now where they can really create the future.”</p>

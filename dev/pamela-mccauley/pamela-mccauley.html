    			<p><strong>Pamela McCauley</strong> joined the UCF faculty in 1993 because she saw tremendous promise, a place with vision for growth that could have a significant impact on the U.S. and the global community. The industrial engineering professor’s work in Malawi assesses communities to determine how and where to introduce technology that can enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of HIV/AIDS health care service delivery.</p>

				<p>“Since I began my career with UCF the institution has gain national recognition as a leader in multiple areas including engineering education, diversity and modeling and simulation. I am very proud that UCF has been recognized as a leading partnership institution as well as one of a few in the country to have an award-winning business Incubator with a thriving entrepreneurial culture. We’ve also seen an increase in the quality of our students that we attract at the graduate and undergraduate level. This enhanced student population has directly influenced the caliber of the scientific research that we’re are able to perform as faculty members.”</p>

				<p>“UCF is a great place for faculty researchers because we have such a broad community that includes experts in virtually every critical discipline as well as a strong industrial community in Central Florida. This means that we can not only develop theories to be evaluated but we also have environments, industries and communities eager to be engaged in the research and application of research project outcomes. As an industrial engineering faculty member with expertise in ergonomics and biomechanics, I realized that there was a need in the Southeast for the development of an academic lab that would meet student educational needs and the emerging research opportunities in this area.”</p>

				<p>“The IMPACT model was developed when I served as a Jefferson Science Fellow with the US Department of State. Simply put, the Innovative Methods, Processes and Critical Technologies (IMPACT) model is a systems approach to evaluating, understanding and integrating enhanced technology and processes into the HIV/AIDS health care service delivery process in developing nations. This means we now have an approach that allows us to identify and integrate technology into even the most remote and technology deprived areas. The IMPACT model assesses the needs and the technology readiness level of a community to determine how and where to introduce technology that can be useful in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of HIV/AIDS Health care service delivery. I can say without question that in my entire career I have never felt more awareness regarding the potential impact of my Industrial Engineering education than when working in this project for the U.S. Department of State and the World Bank. I have also involved my students to increase their appreciation and knowledge on how their engineering education should be used to make a difference in our global society.”</p>

				<p>“STEM education that transitions into viable products is key to spurring innovation, economic development and the well-being of our nation. It is imperative that we encourage underrepresented minorities and women in STEM not only because the demographics of our nation are shifting and these individuals represent rich human resources to meet the burgeoning needs but also, because diversity of thought is essential to acceleration of product development, sustainability and economic growth.”

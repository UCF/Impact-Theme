    			<p><strong>Shibu Yooseph</strong> came to UCF for the opportunity to build a strong multidisciplinary academic and research program in the burgeoning field of genomics and bioinformatics. As a leader in the university’s Faculty Research Cluster initiative, the computer scientist who contributed to the first sequencing of the human genome is helping UCF pioneer new solutions to the world’s greatest challenges. </p>

    			<p>“Genomics and Bioinformatics, which is at the interface of the traditional biological sciences and computational sciences, is well on its way to becoming its own discipline and has been proving to be fundamental in teasing out the complexities of life and offering solutions to vast and diverse challenges like human health and sustainable energy.”</p>

				<p>“My research has been very cross-disciplinary to-date, involving collaborations and applications in the fields of computing, genomics, microbiology, environmental research and biomedical sciences. UCF has strong programs in these areas, and the opportunity to connect these disciplines to address big and important scientific questions and to train the next generation of scientists is a fantastic one.”</p>

				<p>“By their very nature, faculty research clusters span different disciplines. Done right, they have the potential to be greater than the sum of their parts. Faculty research clusters allow development of new fields and disciplines that are currently at the interface of traditional disciplines, and to tackle problems that may not be fully within the reach of a single discipline by itself.”</p>

    			<p>The goal in creating the genomics and bioinformatics faculty cluster is to inspire research that leverages UCF’s strengths in medicine, evolution and ecology, and computer sciences by providing the technical expertise and collaborative opportunities necessary to ask and answer the most important questions of today’s life science. Examples include understanding the genetic basis and evolution of diseases, identifying emerging pathogens, determining genomic hallmarks of species extinctions, and developing algorithms and statistical models to improve the analysis of these fantastical amounts of data.</p>

    			<p><strong>Heather Lawrence</strong> is working to push the evolution of American cybersecurity to protect everything from our financial records to nuclear power plants. The student who transferred to UCF via the DirectConnect to UCF program to earn her bachelor of science degree in computer engineering from UCF and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. is president of Hack@UCF, the Collegiate Cyber Defense Club that participates in national and international competitions and has won three consecutive national championships. And it’s students like her with a passion for information security who are driving one of the most innovative areas of study at UCF.</p>

				<p>“Originally I came to UCF as a Valencia College transfer. I had completed my Engineering AA there and wanted to complete my bachelor’s degree. UCF seemed like a prudent choice with a good engineering program and an affordable college in my backyard.”</p>

				<p>“As a transfer student, I didn't know anyone so I was trying to find my home on the UCF campus. I happened to attend a Hack@UCF weekly meeting at the behest of a friend. It was intimidating as the material they presented was foreign — I had never run Linux before, written code, and didn't know much of anything in security — but the members were very willing to share their knowledge and welcome me. Their passion for information security nurtured my passion for information security.”</p>

				<p>“UCF is home to one of the largest information security student groups in the nation, with about 300 members. We teach both offensive and defensive security through weekly meetings, workshops, conferences, and capture-the-flag (CTF) events. We compete on both a national and international level against colleges such as University of California at Berkeley, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and University of California Santa Barbara and have brought home the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition championship title for three years running.”</p>

				<p>“Many of the protocols and applications we rely on today were not created with security in mind. As our world becomes increasingly connected to the Internet via the mundane, like cars or devices in our home, or the uncommon, like manufacturing and nuclear plants, these protocols and applications are still vulnerable. It falls on us to investigate how they work, break them, and fix them.”</p>

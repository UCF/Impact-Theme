          <blockquote class="sidebar-blockquote">&ldquo;My dream is to design space planes for the commercial space race, and I intend … to assist children in need of a helping hand. Whether in academia, industry or around the globe, I am excited to use engineering to design a better world.&rdquo;</blockquote>

          <p>When Albert Manero was young, his parents taught him the importance of making the world a better place. "[They] always encouraged me to use my education to help others and to dream big dreams," he says. "Now I want to inspire others to help engineer hope for the world."</p>

          <p>Today he's focused on making a positive impact on the grandest and smallest scales. As a doctoral candidate in the College of Engineering and Computer Science and a Fulbright Academic Fellow, Manero’s research uses X-Rays to test advanced aerospace materials for next-generation jet engines that will power hypersonic vehicles designed to accelerate the future of space exploration. "Our collaboration with the <a href="http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/" target="_blank">German Aerospace Center</a> and <a href="http://www.anl.gov/" target="_blank">Argonne National Laboratory</a> has provided incredible research opportunities and innovation," he says. "Learning in such a diverse and globally minded campus prepared me to lead a team spanning nine time zones and across cultural differences."</p>

          <blockquote>&ldquo;The University of Central Florida impressed upon me the importance of outreach, leading me to pursue opportunities to impact the development of students and my community through engineering.&rdquo;</blockquote>

          <p>Manero is also the founder of <a href="http://limbitless-solutions.org/" target="_blank">Limbitless Solutions</a>, a nonprofit devoted to bringing 3-D printed bionic arms and hands to children at no cost to their families. Leading a multidisciplinary group of volunteer UCF students and alumni, he has designed and donated battery-operated devices to young people across the United States, and given the plans to international groups so they can assist children in their regions. “I have a dream that someday we can work with the U.N. and UNICEF to set up 3-D stations around the world to help every child who can benefit from this,” Manero says. And to help future students with disabilities, Manero and his team also <a href="https://www.ucffoundation.org/limbitless" target="_blank">created an endowed scholarship fund</a> for these students to pursue degrees in science, technology, engineering or math at UCF.</p>

          <p>For his volunteer achievements, Manero has been recognized by the <a href="http://office.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Collective Project</a>, and has received the Order of Pegasus, UCF’s most prestigious student award. And his Limbitless Solutions team has expanded their scope to encourage other UCF students to use science, engineering and art to effect positive change through innovation and research.</p>

          <blockquote>&ldquo;I have learned how to ‘dream big dreams’ and about global innovation, which has encouraged me to pursue my aerospace and biomedical engineering research on a global scale.&rdquo;</blockquote>

			<p>When Albert Manero was young, his parents taught him the importance of making the world a better place. "[They] always encouraged me to use my education to help others and to dream big dreams," he says. "Now I want to inspire others to help engineer hope for the world."</p>

			<p>Today he's focused on making a positive impact on the grandest and smallest scales. "Our collaboration with the <a href="http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/" target="_blank">German Aerospace Center</a> and <a href="http://www.anl.gov/" target="_blank">Argonne National Laboratory</a> has provided incredible research opportunities and innovation," he says. "Learning in such a diverse and globally minded campus prepared me to lead a team spanning nine time zones and across cultural differences."</p>
